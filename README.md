HeartRate
=================

A fully functional and beautiful sample app that showcases how to get heart rate sensor data using the Metawear and the pulse sensor.

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **HeartRate.xcworkspace** and not HeartRate.xcodeproj.
